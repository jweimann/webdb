Consider skipping the webapi layer and doing a direct connection 
between the prism client and the server.  Could avoid serialization
and improve performance and simplicity.
- Also check if entities from ef can serialize across as akka messages.  if so
this gets very simplified as we don't need model objects anymore.
(they should be able to if the dynamic/lazy option is off in the config,
that may also eliminate the need for model objects with webapi.)

Find a better way to show relationships in prism where I don't need to duplicate data & manage so much on the server side.
